# README.MD

Hi bestie so if ur reading this then u r looking for how to operate all of this mess. I hope this readme helps u w that!

## preparing a blog post
If you wanna upload a new blog post to neocities, u have to post it in markdown. To convert a post from RTF (u can save a document as RTF in the microsoft word 'save as' menu) u need to run the 'converter.py' file. To do this, just open command line or powershell and navigate to the webdev folder. Then enter the following command, replacing 'FILENAME.rtf' with the name of ur file:

python converter.py "C:\Users\Owner\OneDrive\Documents\webdev\posts\SAMPLE.rtf"

and then u will have ur new post in html to upload!
