		<p>  I've been dying to get my hands on a homelab and I'm officially, like, halfway there!!</p>
		<p>  I ordered my new PC, and it should be here in seven (7) days. I'm so excited! It's an absolute beast of a machine. It’s got a 5080 and a mostly white setup. I’m planning on doing a homelab and a local AI model, but I think both of those will have to wait because I don’t really know anything about either of them.
		  Just to give a rundown of the build:</p>
		<ul>
		<li>AMD Ryzen 9 9950X 16-core</li>
		<li>Water cooling</li>
		<li>4TB HDD</li>
		<li>4TB SATA-III</li>
		<li>64GB DDR5</li>
		<li>850 Watt 80+ Gold Power Supply</li>
		</ul>
		<p>  So, I’m pretty excited abt this lol. I’m not sure how I’m gonna go about switching all of my information over. I’m currently planning to backup all of my stuff to the cloud and what doesn’t go there, will go to my external storage. From there, I should be able to handle the rest of the setup.
		  Once I’m done with all of that, I’ll get to downloading and setting up the VMs, but I’m not entirely sure how I’m gonna set all of that up. When I get it figured out, I’ll make a post about it. One thing I am considering is getting another 64GB of RAM. My motherboard can take it, and I think my wallet can as well (yay Amazon gift card!) but I’m just not sure if I want to actually go ahead with it. It’s not like it’s gonna hurt to do it, though. UGH!!</p>
